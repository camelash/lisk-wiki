# Lisk Wiki

Lisk Wiki aims to write down all the knowledge which is spread
in the heads of Lisk community members. This knowledge should be
searchable and cloneable, released under a free license.

## Whats the difference to the Lisk documentation?

1. This Wiki is not complete and will never be. It has no start, no end
and no order.
Individual pages are pieces of information that should help people searching
for specific information.
2. This Wiki is crowd sourced. Feel free to fix and extend articles or create
entire pages using pull requests.
3. Content in this Wiki is released under a free license that allows everyone
to share and reuse content.
