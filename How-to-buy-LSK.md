## Get a wallet

First of all, you need a [Lisk wallet](/Wallets), a software used to access the blockchain. The official wallet software of Lisk is called Lisk Hub. Download the latest stable version of Lisk Hub for your operating system: https://github.com/LiskHQ/lisk-hub/releases

## Create a Lisk ID

A Lisk ID (sometimes called "account") is created by following "Create a Lisk ID" in Lisk Hub. A passphrase and an address will be generated for you, e.g.:

* Passphrase: "body field road narrow end pretty eyebrow fitness control trap nature glimpse"
* Address: 4575669627358842354L

This address can now be used to receive Lisk. Since your balance is 0 LSK, you cannot send anything.

**Security note:** You do not need to backup your wallet, because using your passphrase you can login using any wallet software on any device. The passphrase however needs to be secured. When you lose it, you lose your LSK. When someone else gets a copy of it, he or she can spent your LSK.

## Buy Lisk from a friend

If you know someone who is willing to trade LSK for something else with you, you can just give him or her your address to receive the LSK. In this case, you need to agree on way to pay the LSK you buy.

## Buy Lisk from an exchange

When you want to buy Lisk using fiat currency, you can use one of these exchanges (Note: exchanges are ordered alphabetically and listing them here is no guarantee they are trustworthy).

The buying process varies from exchange to exchange but at some point, you should be able to tell the exchange, to which Lisk address the LSK should be sent.

## Check your account balance

When the exchange confirms the transaction, you can check your account balance in Lisk Hub using the "Wallet" section. Another way is to search for your address in the [Lisk Explorer](https://explorer.lisk.io/). Your address will be available there as soon as you received the first transaction.
